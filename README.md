# Team reviews labeler 

Github action that automatically label pull requests based on team reviewers.

Currently, it is not very flexibly and just prefixes team slug with `teams/`, for example `action-team` will turn into `teams/action-team` label.

The goal is to provide are more granular to set up your Slack notifications.
